## Lesson 1: Draw a point

In this lesson, we'll learn how to draw a point:

<img src="point.png" width=500>

In the computer world, all pictures are made of pixels. Pixels are addressed by 2 numbers: X and Y. For example, the top left pixel in a picture is `(X=0, Y=0)`, or simply `(0, 0)`. To move to the right, you increase the value of `X`, and to move down, you increase the value of `Y`. Here's what this looks like:

### Challenge 3

Draw point in bottom right

### Challenge 4

### Challenge 6

Draw a point in the center so that its always in the center. Hint: use the `img_width` and `img_height` variables.

### Challenge 7

Draw a point in the center so that its always in the center (even if you resize the image). Hint: use the `img_width` and `img_height` variables.

### Challenge 8

Draw something by modifying the `point.py` program and draw more points. Draw a smily face or something else if you prefer.
