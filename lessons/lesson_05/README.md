## Lesson 5: Shapes

We've drawn some shapes the hard way (using mathematics directly). There are good reasons to learn the hard way (learning the core mathematics behinds the shapes allows a fuller level of control). But now we'll learn the easy way - using the `Pillow` `ImageDraw` library. You can read more about it [here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html). In this library, there are functions which allow us to easily draw various shapes (we have already been using one function in this library - the `draw.point()`). Here are some of the functions:


## Challenges
