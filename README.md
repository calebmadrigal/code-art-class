# code-art-class

A class for learning to do art with math and code (Python).

To get an idea of what sort of art is possible with these methods, check out: <https://gods.art/math_art.html> - all the pictures on this page are made with the techniques taught in this class.

## Introduction

In this class, we'll learn how to do art with Python programming. Some things you can learn in this class include:

* Basic Python programming
* How to use Python libraries
* How computer graphics work
* Some cool math

For each lesson (in the `lessons` folder), just read the `README.md` file and follow along.

## Setup

In order to follow along with this class, you must have:

* Python installed: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
* Pillow (the Python Image Library): <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>
    - This command should install it: `pip install Pillow`
* A text editor which you can use to edit `.py` files (I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)).
