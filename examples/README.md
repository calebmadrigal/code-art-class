# Algorithmic art examples

This is a collection of python scripts for doing algorithmic art. All of these use the Pillow library (aka Python Image Library).




## How to run

Make sure you hvae Pillow installed by doing:

    pip install pillow

And to run a script, go to a command-line and run:

    python3 line_easy.py




## Recommendations for play

I recommend not modifying any of these files. Instead, when you want to play around, just copy and rename a file, and then edit that file. For example:

    cp wave.py wave2.py

Then you can easily play with `wave2.py`, and you'll always have the original `wave.py` to look back at.
